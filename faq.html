          <h4>Fequently Asked Questions</h4>
          <div class="questions">
            <span>HOW MANY PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE INCLUDED IN YOUR (EX:WEDDING) COVERAGE OPTIONS</span>
            <p>We always have a second photographer along with us on your wedding day, unless you have a guest count of 25 people or less. We also bring along an assistant to help keep track of our equipment as well as to ensure that we stay on schedule. It allows us photographers to keep our focus on creating the most beautiful images we can!</p>

            <span>WILL WE RECEIVE HIGH RESOLUTION JPEGS</span>
            <p>Yes! We will provide a set of color jpegs as well as a copy of black and white jpegs, all of which will be high resolution.</p>

            <span>DO YOU PROVIDE PRINTS</span>
            <p>As much as we love digital photography, nothing can replace holding your wedding photos in your own hands! However we do not have them included in your photo package. BUT we do offer options to purchase prints and other great products (We will give more pricing in person.)</p>

            <span>DO YOU OFFER ANY DISCOUNTS</span>
            <p>We completely understand that weddings may be costly, unfortunately, we are not able to offer discounts or negotiate our rates. We put a great amount of care and hard work into each of our weddings and refuse to provide less than our best work, period. We do however, offer special packages for intimate, weekday weddings.</p>

            <span>DO YOU OFFER CUSTOM COVERAGE</span>
            <p>We are more than happy to provide custom coverage for your specific needs. Please email us and let us know what you are looking for and we will send over a quote for you!</p>

            <span>HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY IMAGES</span>
            <p>It takes between 2-3 weeks after your wedding day to received your images. Usually they are done sooner but we cannot guarantee the exact time they will be ready. Please be prepared to wait the maximum amount of time. We are more than happy to email you a few samples to share or use for Thank You cards if you email us and ask.</p>

            <span>WHEN IS FINAL PAYMENT DUE</span>
            <p>We require a 50% deposit on the day of your photo session or in advance. Final payment is due upon arrival of your products/images.</p>

            <span>WHAT FORMS OF PAYMENT DO YOU ACCEPT</span>
            <p>We currently accept cash, check, or credit/debit card payments through Squareup.
            We require half the total amount as a deposit when booked.</p>

            <span>WHY DO YOU CHARGE TAX</span>
            <p>Many people don’t realize that photography is taxable. Labor and service are taxable in California which is why we charge a additional 9.5% tax on all of our coverage options.</p>

            <span>ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR DESTINATION WEDDINGS</span>
            <p>We love destination weddings! We will travel just about anywhere you’d like to get married. Please email us for more information on pricing and availability!</p>

            <span>WILL YOU BE AVAILABLE TO DO A SITE VISIT WITH US BEFORE OUR WEDDING</span>
            <p>We are more than happy to visit your wedding venue and do a complimentary walk through with you, preferably at a time close to your wedding date so that we can see what the lighting conditions will be like on your wedding day.</p>

            <span>WHAT IF WE’D LIKE TO KEEP OUR IMAGES PRIVATE</span>
            <p>If you are uncomfortable with us blogging or posting your images, please let us know! We love to share our photos so that new clients can see our work but we understand and respect your right to privacy.</p>

            <span>CAN WE ORDER EXTRA PRINTS OR USB DRIVES</span>
            <p>We have the option to purchase prints. If you would like to reorder just let us know!
            We also offer copies of your USB drives for $150 if your relatives want their own.</p>

            <span>WHAT SHOULD I/WE WEAR</span>
            <p>It is best to keep clothing simple, avoiding logos or busy patterns. I always suggest layers/textures. In group photos, color coordinating is always more pleasing to the eye. Wear clothes that represent you and who you are. Feel free to bring a change of clothing.</p>

            <span>WHAT TO BRING</span>
            <p> For family and/or children photo sessions: outfit changes, a drink, favorite toy, special stuffed animal. Please make sure your little one has been fed and had a nap before the photo session for a more comfortable and positive experience.</p>
